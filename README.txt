DataClasses.py holds the basic class data structures
SourceData.py uses the basic data structures to generate a list of Source objects and populate them with LCA data (embedded in the file)
ScenModelUS.py is the primary model code, which runs SourceData.main to generate the set of sources and data, reads in csv files to specify a scenario, and outputs a tuple of results. 
BatchScenUS.py is a wrapper for ScenModelUS that is used to run variations on a basic scenario. It also provides an example of embedding the model in other scripts.

All necessary csv files can be generated from a single Numbers spreadsheet, and the included BAU_PA.numbers is provided as an example, as well as BAU_PA.xls (BAU_PA.pdf is provided as a visual example for those that do not have Numbers installed). 

This software was developed using Spyder as an interactive frontend, which is available for free for both Windows and Macintosh platforms. 

Journal papers describing the model are in submission, and this work should be cited as (titles tentative pending review):
